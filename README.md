# Benchmarking Mutect!

This is the code repo for my master thesis in Broad institute. This work is mentored by Julian Hess, Chet Birger and Gad Getz. Thanks to all! I love every seconds I work in the lab :)

Code here is mostly for self record, in the form of markdown notes.
Detailed description coming soon -
