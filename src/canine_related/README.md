# Example .yaml files

* `yaml_examples/LUAD_pon.yaml` for running all normal LUAD samples with tumor only mode. This file is generated by `make_pon_yaml.py` with a paired tsv file containing google paths for tumor and normals from dalmatian.
* `yaml_examples/SARCmake_pon.yaml` for scattered workflow of GenomicsDBImport > CreatePON on all SARC normal M2 results scattered by 1000 genome pieces. The genome is fragmented by scripts in `../split_intervals`
* `yaml_exmaples/all_in_one_pon.yaml` same purpose as `SARCmake_pon.yaml` but runs on all available samples. **I manually deleted some samples that does not work (ERROR: cannot create reader etc..) and this is the working version** containing ~3k normals. *With that being said, the direct result from `makeBigPON.py` is not the all_in_onemake_pon.yaml*
